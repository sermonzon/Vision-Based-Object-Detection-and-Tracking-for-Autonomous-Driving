## Overview

This project addresses the challenges of object detection, tracking, and classification in occlusion-prone urban environments for autonomous driving systems. Using a vision-based approach with stereo cameras, we focus on:

- Calibrating and rectifying a stereo camera setup.
- Detecting and tracking objects in 3D.
- Classifying objects into categories: pedestrians, cyclists, and cars.
- Handling occlusions to maintain continuous tracking and motion prediction.

The system is developed and evaluated using real-world datasets that reflect dynamic urban environments.
